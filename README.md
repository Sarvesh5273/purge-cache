# // PURGE_CACHE

> A digital ceremony for the modern developer.

## 01 // THE CONCEPT
We debug our code, but we never debug our brains. `// PURGE_CACHE` is a terminal-based ritual that treats mental stress as "corrupted memory segments." 

## 02 // HOW IT WORKS
- **Identify**: Type your current "system load" (your worry).
- **Analyze**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash acting as "The Core" (a stoic OS) evaluates the emotional weight.
- **Color Shift**: The UI shifts color based on the sentiment (Red for Critical, Blue for Melancholy).
- **Patch**: The Core generates a poetic "system patch" to reframe your perspective.
- **Purge**: Visual glitch effects "delete" the thought from your local RAM.

## 03 // TECH STACK
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **AI**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (Direct Integration)
- **Vibe**: CSS Scanlines, Glitch Keyframes, Fira Code Typography

## 04 // INSTALLATION
1. `npm install`
